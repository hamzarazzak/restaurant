Just Eat - QA Automation Engineer Technical Exercise
---------------------------------------------------------

We would like to asses your technical ability in producing functional tests written in ruby (cucumber).

You will need to install ruby 1.9.x or better.

To make sure you have all the required dependencies, you will need to run "bundle install" from the root directory.

We have included an example scenarios - you will need to write the step definitions.

Please add a couple more scenarios that you think would enhance the test coverage of the site.

To run the tests -> "bundle exec rake"

Good luck :-)
